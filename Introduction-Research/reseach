       Since version 4.0, [1;36mnano[0m by default:[m
[m
           ‚Ä¢ does not automatically hard-wrap lines that become overlong,[m
           ‚Ä¢ includes the line below the title bar in the editing area,[m
           ‚Ä¢ does linewise (smooth) scrolling.[m
[m
       If you want the old, Pico behavior back, you can use [1;36m--breaklonglines[0m, [1;36m--emptyline[0m, and [1;36m--jumpyscrolling[0m (or [1;36m-bej[0m for short).[m
[m
[1;36mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1;36mnano[0m is a small and friendly editor.  It copies the look and feel of Pico, but is free software, and implements several features that Pico lacks, such as:[m
       opening multiple files, scrolling per line, undo/redo, syntax coloring, line numbering, and soft-wrapping overlong lines.[m
[m
       When giving a filename on the command line, the cursor can be put on a specific line by adding the line number with a plus sign ([1;36m+[0m) before  the  filename,[m
       and  even  in a specific column by adding it with a comma.  (Negative numbers count from the end of the file or line.)  The cursor can be put on the first[m
       or last occurrence of a specific string by specifying that string after [1;36m+/[0m or [1;36m+?[0m before the filename.  The string can be made case sensitive and/or caused[m
       to  be interpreted as a regular expression by inserting [1;36mc[0m and/or [1;36mr[0m after the [1;36m+[0m sign.  These search modes can be explicitly disabled by using the uppercase[m
       variant of those letters: [1;36mC[0m and/or [1;36mR[0m.  When the string contains spaces, it needs to be enclosed in quotes.  To give an example: to  open  a  file  at  the[m
       first occurrence of the word "Foo", one would do:[m

[1;36mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1;36mnetcat[0m  is a simple unix utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using TCP or UDP protocol. It is designed to be a reliable "back-[m
       end" tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts.  At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging  and  explo‚Äê[m
       ration  tool,  since it can create almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities.  Netcat, or "nc" as the[m
       actual program is named, should have been supplied long ago as another one of those cryptic but standard Unix tools.[m
[m
       In the simplest usage, "nc host port" creates a TCP connection to the given port on the given target host.  Your standard input is then sent to the  host,[m
       and anything that comes back across the connection is sent to your standard output.  This continues indefinitely, until the network side of the connection[m
       shuts down.  Note that this behavior is different from most other applications which shut everything down and exit after an end-of-file  on  the  standard[m
       input.[m
[m
       Netcat  can  also  function  as a server, by listening for inbound connections on arbitrary ports and then doing the same reading and writing.  With minor[m
       limitations, netcat doesn't really care if it runs in "client" or "server" mode -- it still shovels data back and forth until there isn't any  more  left.[m
       In either mode, shutdown can be forced after a configurable time of inactivity on the network side.[m
[m
       And  it can do this via UDP too, so netcat is possibly the "udp telnet-like" application you always wanted for testing your UDP-mode servers.  UDP, as the[m
       "U" implies, gives less reliable data transmission than TCP connections and some systems may have trouble sending large amounts of data that way, but it's[m
       still a useful capability to have.[m
[m
       You may be asking "why not just use telnet to connect to arbitrary ports?" Valid question, and here are some reasons.  Telnet has the "standard input EOF"[m
       problem, so one must introduce calculated delays in driving scripts to allow network output to finish.  This is the main reason netcat stays running until[m
       the *network* side closes.  Telnet also will not transfer arbitrary binary data, because certain characters are interpreted as telnet options and are thus[m
       removed from the data stream.  Telnet also emits some of its diagnostic messages to standard output, where netcat keeps such things religiously  separated[m
