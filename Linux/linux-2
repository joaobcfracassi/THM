[m
[1mNAME[0m[m
       find - search for files in a directory hierarchy[m
[m
[1mSYNOPSIS[0m[m
       [1mfind[0m [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [expression][m
[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       This  manual  page  documents  the  GNU version of [1mfind[0m.  GNU [1mfind[0m searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point by evaluating the given[m
       expression from left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand side is  false  for[m
       [4mand[24m operations, true for [4mor[24m), at which point [1mfind[0m moves on to the next file name.  If no starting-point is specified, `.' is assumed.[m
[m
       If  you  are  using  [1mfind[0m  in an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it to search directories that are writable by other[m
       users), you should read the `Security Considerations' chapter of the findutils documentation, which is called [1mFinding[0m  [1mFiles[0m  and  comes  with  findutils.[m
       That document also includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it a more useful source of information.[m
[m
[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
       The  [1m-H[0m,  [1m-L[0m and [1m-P[0m options control the treatment of symbolic links.  Command-line arguments following these are taken to be names of files or directories[m
       to be examined, up to the first argument that begins with `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following arguments are taken to be  the[m
       expression describing what is to be searched for.  If no paths are given, the current directory is used.  If no expression is given, the expression [1m-print[0m[m
       is used (but you should probably consider using [1m-print0[0m instead, anyway).[m
[m
       This manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.  These options control the behaviour of [1mfind[0m but are specified  immediately  after  the[m
       last  path  name.   The five `real' options [1m-H[0m, [1m-L[0m, [1m-P[0m, [1m-D[0m and [1m-O[0m must appear before the first path name, if at all.  A double dash [1m--[0m can also be used to[m
       signal that any remaining arguments are not options (though ensuring that all start points begin with either `./' or `/' is generally  safer  if  you  use[m
       wildcards in the list of start points).[m
[m
       -P     Never follow symbolic links.  This is the default behaviour.  When [1mfind[0m examines or prints information a file, and the file is a symbolic link, the[m
              information used shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.[m
[m
       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When [1mfind[0m examines or prints information about files, the information used shall be taken from the properties of  the  file[m
              to  which  the  link  points, not from the link itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or [1mfind[0m is unable to examine the file to which the link[m
              points).  Use of this option implies [1m-noleaf[0m.  If you later use the [1m-P[0m option, [1m-noleaf[0m will still be in effect.  If [1m-L[0m is in effect and  [1mfind[0m  dis‚Äê[m
              covers a symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirectory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.[m
[m
              When  the [1m-L[0m option is in effect, the [1m-type[0m predicate will always match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to rather than the[m
              link itself (unless the symbolic link is broken).  Actions that can cause symbolic links to become broken while  [1mfind[0m  is  executing  (for  example[m
[7m Manual page find(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K              [1m-delete[0m) can give rise to confusing behaviour.  Using [1m-L[0m causes the [1m-lname[0m and [1m-ilname[0m predicates always to return false.[m

[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
     [1msudo[0m allows a permitted user to execute a [4mcommand[24m as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy.  The invoking user's real ([4mnot[24m[m
     effective) user ID is used to determine the user name with which to query the security policy.[m
[m
     [1msudo[0m supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/output logging.  Third parties can develop and distribute their own policy and I/O log‚Äê[m
     ging plugins to work seamlessly with the [1msudo[0m front end.  The default security policy is [4msudoers[24m, which is configured via the file [4m/etc/sudoers[24m, or via[m
     LDAP.  See the [4mPlugins[24m section for more information.[m
[m
     The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to run [1msudo[0m.  The policy may require that users authenticate themselves with a password[m
     or another authentication mechanism.  If authentication is required, [1msudo[0m will exit if the user's password is not entered within a configurable time limit.[m
     This limit is policy-specific; the default password prompt timeout for the [4msudoers[24m security policy is unlimited.[m
[m
     Security policies may support credential caching to allow the user to run [1msudo[0m again for a period of time without requiring authentication.  The [4msudoers[24m[m
     policy caches credentials for 15 minutes, unless overridden in sudoers(5).  By running [1msudo[0m with the [1m-v[0m option, a user can update the cached credentials[m
     without running a [4mcommand[24m.[m
[m
     When invoked as [1msudoedit[0m, the [1m-e[0m option (described below), is implied.[m
[m
     Security policies may log successful and failed attempts to use [1msudo[0m.  If an I/O plugin is configured, the running command's input and output may be logged[m
     as well.[m
[m
     The options are as follows:[m
[m
     [1m-A[0m, [1m--askpass[0m[m
                 Normally, if [1msudo[0m requires a password, it will read it from the user's terminal.  If the [1m-A[0m ([4maskpass[24m) option is specified, a (possibly graphi‚Äê[m
                 cal) helper program is executed to read the user's password and output the password to the standard output.  If the SUDO_ASKPASS environment[m
[7m Manual page sudo(8) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K                 variable is set, it specifies the path to the helper program.  Otherwise, if sudo.conf(5) contains a line specifying the askpass program, that[m
